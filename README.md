Diploma Final Year Project.

# Introduction
 This system aims at maintaining patient health records and even getting appointments from various doctors for related treatments. The Health Prediction application is an end user support and online consultation project. Here we propose an android application that allows users to get instant guidance on their health issues through an intelligent health care application online. The system user must register as a member of this system and keep updating his medical history. Patients can then select from a list of specialized doctors for respective treatments at particular locations. Patients may also select suitable appointment timings for their meeting.
